# CS340 Client/Server Development

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To make my code maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I organized it into clear functions, added comments, and used consistent naming. In Project One, writing a separate CRUD module made it easy to connect to the MongoDB database, and in Project Two, I reused it to connect the dashboard filters and charts without rewriting everything. This saved time and made updates easier. I could definitely reuse this module in future apps that need to manage or display animal shelter data.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

When approaching a problem like this, I first try to fully understand the requirements, then break them into smaller parts, like filters, charts, and database queries, and build them one step at a time. This project was more realistic and hands-on than others I’ve done, especially with tying together front-end and back-end parts. In the future, I’d continue using modular code and testing often to stay organized and catch issues early.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists build tools that solve real problems. Projects like this help companies like Grazioso Salvare work faster and smarter, getting rescue dogs where they’re needed more efficiently. That kind of impact makes the work feel meaningful.
